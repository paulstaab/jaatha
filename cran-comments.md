Please excuse the short time since the last submission. I introduced a severe
bug in the last version which can cause false results in some situations. This
release fixes it.

## Test environments
* Fedora 23 (local), R 3.2.3
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.2.3
* Windows (on AppVeyor), R-devel
* win-builder (R-devel and R-release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs (other than CRAN incomming feasibility).

## Downstream dependencies
No packages are depending on jaatha.
